# MovieNight

A Flutter application to view information about movies, TV shows and people (actors, directors, etc.).
You can sign in with your Google account and save your favourite movies, TV shows and actors and add them to a watchlist or watch
history.

## TODO
- Saved items pagination (infinite scroll)
- Infinite scroll on search and genre page?
- Add toasts
- Sort saved items by timestamp asc and desc
- Also show popular and top rated movies and TV Shows
- Search:
  - Suggestions with debouncing.
  - Search results page remains on the same tab on back button pressed (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/43582).
  - Implement own search page?
- Able to see more videos than just the trailer and more images (separate page?)
