# MovieNight

A Flutter application to view information about your favourite movies, TV shows and actors.

## TODO
- Split into smaller widgets instead of functions returning widgets.
- Use Future builder to wait for results instead of conditional widgets.
- Episode details?
- Sort results by available parameters
- API locales (get countries)
- Able to see more videos than just the trailer?
- Search suggestions
- Search results page remains on the same tab on back button pressed (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/43582)

## Authentication
- Log in with google
